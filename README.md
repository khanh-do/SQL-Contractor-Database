# SQL-Contractor-Database
Contractor Database:
This code creates a database to manage my list of contractors whom I may hire for home repair and maintenance. The primary entity for this database is a Contractor. This code creates a master list for each contractor that will show the name of the Contractor (or business), the main contact person’s name, phone number, the address, city, state, the type(s) of service they provide, if I have used their service before, how do I rate their service (I will define my own rating based on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the best) based on my own experience or by referral, a rating of their cost, the referral source (how I found them), and a comment section. This code contains sample queries to present the data. A query produces a list of all of the contractors by the type of service they provide. This list includes the Contractor name, the main contact person’s name, their phone number, address, the city, state, their service and rating. This list is sorted by the service and within the same service their performance rating in descending order.
